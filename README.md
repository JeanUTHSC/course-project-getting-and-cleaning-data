2. `TidyDataSet.txt`: The tidy data set prepared using the above R script, 
3. `CodeBook.md`: A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data,
4. `README.md`: Explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
